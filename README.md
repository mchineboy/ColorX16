# ColorX16

This project aims to be BBS software for the Commander X16. The basic pattern will be modeled after "Color 64" by Greg Pfountz. The main language will be Prog8.

## Status

Currently I'm just working on each module as time permits. Since this is 100% a hobby project, I'm not going to be investing a lot of time into it.

## Todo

- Need a UART/COM driver for the BBS. The assumption is that it will live as Device 2 like the C64 used.
- Create the event loop for communication, user interface, and general management.
